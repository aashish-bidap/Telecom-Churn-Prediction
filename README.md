# Title Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom

# Description
The objective of the project is to build a model to preedict the probability of the customer churning from the platfrom for a telecom data.<br>
Dataset Source : This dataset is based on IBM based sample dataset obtained from Kaggle for Customer Churn.<br>
Dimensions for the DataSet [rows vs columns]: 7043 * 21.<br>
The Data set includes information about:<br>
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.<br>
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.<br>
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.<br>
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.<br>

## Environment
- R Studio, R (ggplot2,dplyr,randomForest,corrplot)

## Tasks performed:
- Data Cleaning
- EDA
- Feature Engineering and Optimization
- Data Modeling.
- We implemented Logistic Regresion and found an accuracy of 79.01%.
- Further we tried implementing the Decision Tree classifier but did not find any improvement in our accuracy.
- Lastly we performed random forest claasifier and we observed an accuracy of 80.07%
